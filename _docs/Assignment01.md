## The Project

 Our project aims to create a robust poker training application designed for Windows terminal-based environments using C++. The app offers a variety of game modes, including Training and Challenge modes, allowing users to practice against AI opponents of varying difficulty levels. It features educational resources analytics and feedback to help players improve their skills and track their progress.

## "Back to Basics" Approach

To uphold our "Back to Basics" approach, our project will be written in C++ without external libraries. We'll interact solely through the terminal for user input and output, without any graphical user interface (GUI). Our project scope is intentionally narrow, with provisions for potential expansions based on available time and resources.

## Project Development

- Object oriented design allowing for the underlying code to be easily ported to any GUI
- Visual Studio Code for our development environment
- Discord group chat as our communication platform
- GitHub Project board for tracking issues, bugs and the project's development
- We have arranged a couple two hour meeting times every week dedicated to peer programming and project organization
